## Description of Service

Tinnitussaurus is a sound therapy application that provides customizable audio tones and notched sound therapy to help manage tinnitus symptoms.

## Medical Disclaimer

Tinnitussaurus is **not a medical device** and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any medical condition. It is a wellness tool that provides sound therapy techniques based on published research.

**Consult a healthcare professional if your tinnitus:**

Do not use this app as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

## Volume Safety

You are responsible for maintaining safe listening volumes. Prolonged exposure to loud sounds can cause hearing damage. Keep therapy volume at a comfortable level — never attempt to mask your tinnitus by increasing volume to painful levels.
